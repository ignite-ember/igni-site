/**
 * Every file in `pages/` has a test that renders it.
 *
 * Not a rule that could be applied all at once: eleven of the thirty
 * had nothing when this was written. So it was built as a **ratchet**,
 * the same shape as `primitives.test.ts` — a list of what is still
 * owed, allowed to shrink and never to grow. That list is now empty,
 * which turns it into a plain rule: a new file in `pages/` fails until
 * something tests it.
 *
 * ## Why a rule rather than a list somebody greps for
 *
 * I counted this by hand twice and got it wrong twice.
 *
 * The first attempt matched a page's name anywhere in any `*.test.tsx`,
 * which counted `AccessPage`, `DocsPage` and `EventsPage` as covered
 * because `primitives.test.ts` — a CSS ratchet that renders nothing —
 * names their stylesheets. On that basis I reported that every routed
 * page had a test. It did not.
 *
 * The second attempt looked only for `__tests__/<Name>.test.tsx`, which
 * is right, but by then the number had already been stated wrongly.
 *
 * The third attempt required only a file named `<Name>.test.tsx`, and
 * over-reported the other way: `SettingsPage` and `LandingPage` are
 * genuinely exercised, by tests named after the sections inside them
 * (`SessionsSection.test.tsx`, `ProfileForm.test.tsx`). A filename
 * convention is not the property anybody cares about.
 *
 * So what counts is **imported by a test file** — which is as close to
 * "some test renders it" as a static check gets, and does not care what
 * the test is called. What it deliberately does not count is being
 * imported by another *page* that a test happens to render: seven
 * sections once reached the DOM through their parent page's test with
 * nothing asserting their own behaviour, and calling that coverage is
 * how the first count went wrong. When they got tests of their own,
 * four of those seven test files turned out to pass while asserting
 * nothing — the same class of defect one level up.
 *
 * A count nobody can hold in their head is a count to derive, and this
 * one needed the same discipline as everything else it measures.
